# Employee Attrition Analysis and Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting employee attrition within an organization using various tree-based algorithms. The goal is to develop a model that accurately predicts the likelihood of employees leaving the company, enabling proactive measures to be taken to retain valuable talent.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis contains historical information about employees, including various features such as age, job role, salary, performance ratings, work experience, and more. It also includes a binary target variable indicating whether an employee has left the company (1) or not (0).

## Algorithms Used

In this project, all tree-based algorithms available were used to predict employee attrition. The algorithms used include:

1. Random Forest: A popular ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions.

2. Decision Tree: A simple tree-based algorithm that creates a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences.

3. Gradient Boosting: A technique that builds an ensemble of weak prediction models (typically decision trees) in a sequential manner, where each model focuses on correcting the mistakes made by the previous models.

4. XGBoost: An optimized implementation of gradient boosting that provides better performance and scalability.

## Analysis and Results

The analysis process involved the following steps:

1. Data Preprocessing: The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables. Feature engineering techniques were applied to extract relevant information and create new features if necessary.

2. Feature Selection: The most important features were identified using techniques such as feature importance from random forests, correlation analysis, and domain knowledge.

3. Model Training and Evaluation: The dataset was divided into training and testing sets. All the tree-based algorithms mentioned earlier were trained on the training set and evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics. The models were fine-tuned by adjusting hyperparameters to optimize performance.

4. Model Comparison: The performance of each algorithm was assessed based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve was computed to measure the overall predictive capability of the models.

After trying all available tree-based algorithms and performing extensive optimizations, the random forest algorithm achieved the highest accuracy score of 0.87 in predicting employee attrition. It indicates that the model can correctly classify 87% of the employees as either leaving or not leaving the company.

## Conclusion

In this project, we successfully analyzed and predicted employee attrition using various tree-based algorithms. The random forest algorithm demonstrated strong performance, achieving an accuracy score of 0.87.

By accurately predicting employee attrition, organizations can take proactive measures to address the issue and retain valuable talent. However, it's important to note that employee attrition is a complex phenomenon influenced by multiple factors. While the tree-based algorithms provided promising results, there may be other non-measurable or external factors that could impact attrition rates.

Continuous monitoring and analysis of new data, as well as incorporating qualitative feedback from employees, can provide valuable insights into the attrition issue. Additionally, considering a holistic approach that includes HR policies, employee satisfaction initiatives, and organizational improvements can further enhance efforts to mitigate employee attrition.

Overall, the analysis and prediction of employee attrition using tree-based algorithms provide a valuable foundation for organizations to make informed decisions and take proactive measures in managing their workforce.
