# Employee Attrition Analysis and Prediction

This repository contains code and resources for analyzing and predicting employee attrition using various tree-based algorithms. The goal of this project is to gain insights into the factors that contribute to attrition and build a predictive model that can accurately identify employees at risk of leaving.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis and prediction task contains information about employees, including their demographics, job-related factors, and other relevant features. It also includes a target variable indicating whether an employee has churned (1) or not (0).

## Algorithms Used

In this project, we explored multiple tree-based algorithms to predict employee attrition. The following algorithms were employed:

- Random Forest
- Decision Tree
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost
- AdaBoost

By utilizing different algorithms, we aimed to compare their performances and select the one that provides the best accuracy in predicting employee attrition.

## Analysis Steps

The following steps were performed in the analysis and prediction process:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset was carefully preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables. Feature engineering techniques may have been employed to create new features that capture meaningful information.

2. **Data Exploration**: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to gain insights into the dataset, identify patterns, and understand the relationships between variables. Visualizations and statistical summaries were used to explore the data.

3. **Feature Selection**: Feature selection techniques such as correlation analysis, feature importance, and stepwise selection were utilized to identify the most relevant features for predicting employee attrition.

4. **Model Training**: The dataset was split into training and testing sets. All the tree-based algorithms mentioned above were trained on the training set using various hyperparameter configurations.

5. **Model Evaluation**: The trained models were evaluated on the testing set using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The performance of each algorithm was compared to determine the best-performing model.

6. **Prediction**: The model with the highest accuracy (Random Forest) was used to predict employee attrition on new, unseen data.

## Results

After implementing the above steps, we achieved an accuracy of 0.87 in predicting employee attrition using the Random Forest algorithm. This means that the model correctly classified 87% of the employees as either churned or not churned. However, it is important to note that accuracy alone may not provide a complete picture of the model's performance, and other metrics should be considered as well.

## Future Improvements

To further enhance the analysis and prediction of employee attrition, the following improvements can be considered:

- **Feature Engineering**: Explore additional feature engineering techniques to create more informative features that capture subtle patterns related to attrition.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize the hyperparameters of each tree-based algorithm to potentially improve their performances further.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the analysis and prediction of employee attrition using various tree-based algorithms. With an accuracy of 0.87 achieved using the Random Forest algorithm, we have built a model that can effectively identify employees at risk of leaving. The insights gained from this analysis can be valuable for organizations to take proactive measures in retaining their valuable workforce and improving employee satisfaction. Further improvements can be made by incorporating advanced techniques and collecting additional data to enhance the accuracy and predictive power of
